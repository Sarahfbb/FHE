When you're ready to use Concrete ML for FHE compilation:

You'll use Concrete ML's tools to convert your trained PyTorch model to an FHE-compatible version.
Concrete ML will handle the necessary adaptations for FHE compatibility.
You may need to fine-tune the converted model to regain any lost accuracy.


During the Concrete ML compilation process, you might need to make some adjustments based on Concrete ML's requirements or recommendations. This could include:

Adjusting activation functions (e.g., replacing ReLU with a polynomial approximation).
Modifying or removing operations that are not supported in the FHE context.
